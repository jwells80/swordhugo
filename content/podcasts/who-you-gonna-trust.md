With everyone telling you what to do and how to live your life, what voice can you hear, who can you trust. Utilizing a song from her album "Reflections" Buffy St. John points you to "That Voice." It's that voice that calls you when ever you stray it's that voice that whispers to you when you pray, He speaks peace and causes your heart to rejoice.
